Observations based on PyCitySchools Analysis

1. All of the top 5 performing schools where Charter type schools and all had a 100 percent pass rate.;
   This suggests that Charter schools in the PyCity school system do a more effecitve job of teaching the math and reading curriculum, than the 
   district schools. However, the analysis requested does not allow for a clear picture of cost differences between Charter and District schools.
   there is also no accounting for demographics of the student body which may influnece student performance.
   
2. Small and Medium sized schools both have 100 percent pass rates while Large schools only have a 95 percent pass rate. This suggests
   that there is some difficulty for Large schools in effectively teaching the math and reading curriculum, which is related to size of the 
   student body. However, the analysis requested does not allow for a clear picture of cost differences between school sizes. There is no 
   data related to class size or demographics which would allow for further exploration of this observation.
   
3. Schools with a Budget per Student up to $615 all had 100 percent pass rates while schools budgeting more than $615 per student only had
   a pass rate of about 95 percent. This observation suggests good news in the fact that the lower cost schools have better student outcomes, but
   there is bad news in that the most expensive schools are not performing in spite of the highr funding. Using the observation form this table
   and referencing back to the top and bottom performing school tables, we can see that PyCity Charter schools generally budget less per 
   student.
   
When we put all three of these observations together, the data appears to support expansion of the charter school program.
