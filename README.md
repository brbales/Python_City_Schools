PyCitySchools:

Help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Data provided includes every student's math and reading scores, and information about the individual schools. Aggregate the data to find and showcase trends in school performance.
Your final output should include the following:

District Summary:
A table showing high-level picture of the key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

School Summary:
Create an overview table that summarizing individual school metrics:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per School Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate):
Create a table that highlighting the top 5 performing schools. Include the same metrics as above.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate):
Create a table that highlighting the bottom 5 performing schools. Include all of the same metrics from above.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Math Scores by Grade:
Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading Scores by Grade:
Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scores by School Spending:
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on spending per student. Use bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math
% Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scores by School Size:
Repeat the above breakdown grouping schools based on an approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scores by School Type:
create another breakdown grouping schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Notes:**
Script must work for both data-sets given.
Use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
Include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on the expected format.
